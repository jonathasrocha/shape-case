# Answer to Shape's Data Engineering Interview


head -n 30 challenge-de-interview/equpment_failure_sensors.txt

This is a example of solution to Shape's Data Engineering Interview, i have tried to use a design pattern that simulate the environment with thres layes Bronze (raw file), Silver and Gold. 
At first layer i saved the files almost original equipment, equipment_sensor(relationships between sensors and equipmentâ€™s) and equipment_failure_sensors (log's table), the second layer i aplied the SD2 (https://decisionworks.com/2000/10/design-tip-15-combining-scd-techniques/) from dim_equipment done through equipment and created a table named equipment_failure_sensors this is a transformation of equipment_failure_sensors file in general is split the file to do analysis easier. 
At last layer i created a table summarized to answer theses four question:

How much the Total equipment failures that happened?

```
    select
        count(equipment_id)
    from equipment.equipment_failure_mart
    
```
Which equipment name had most failures?

```
    select
        equipment_id,
        sum(count)
    from equipment.equipment_failure_mart
    order by sum(count) desc

```
Average amount of failures across equipment group, ordered by the number of failures in ascending order?

```
    select
        group_name,
        avg(count)
    from equipment.equipment_failure_mart
    order by sum(count) desc

```

Rank the sensors which present the most number of errors by equipment name in an equipment group.

```
    select
        name,
        group_name,
        sum(count)
    from equipment.equipment_failure_mart
    group by name, group_name
    order by sum(count) desc
    limit 10
```
